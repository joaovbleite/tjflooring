  {
    patterns: ['what is a load bearing wall', 'which walls are structural', 'can i remove a wall', 'load bearing vs non load bearing', 'structural wall'],
    response: "Load-bearing walls support the weight of elements above them, while non-load-bearing walls (also called partition walls) simply divide spaces. Typically, walls running perpendicular to floor and ceiling joists are load-bearing, as are exterior walls and walls stacked vertically through multiple floors. Signs a wall might be load-bearing include being thicker, having beams or posts, or sitting above foundation walls. Never remove any wall without professional assessment, as even non-load-bearing walls might contain plumbing, electrical, or HVAC components. Our team can evaluate which walls can be safely modified during your renovation."

  {
    patterns: ['what is backsplash', 'need backsplash?', 'backsplash purpose', 'why install backsplash', 'what does backsplash do'],
    response: "A backsplash is the protective wall covering installed between countertops and upper cabinets, primarily in kitchens and bathrooms. Its practical purpose is protecting walls from water, grease, and food splatter, making cleaning easier. Beyond function, backsplashes provide significant design impact, often serving as the kitchen's focal point. Materials range from ceramic tile and glass to natural stone, metal, or even quartz matching your countertops. While not absolutely required, backsplashes are highly recommended for both wall protection and aesthetic enhancement, typically extending 18-20 inches above countertops except behind ranges where they often reach the hood."

  {
    patterns: ['hvac load calculation', 'manual j calculation', 'hvac sizing', 'right size air conditioner', 'proper hvac tonnage'],
    response: "HVAC load calculations using Manual J methodology assess your home's specific cooling and heating requirements based on multiple variables including square footage, ceiling height, insulation values, window specifications, air infiltration rates, local climate data, and internal heat gains. Unlike simplified tonnage rules of thumb, proper Manual J calculations prevent both undersizing (causing inadequate temperature control) and oversizing (leading to short-cycling, poor humidity control, and reduced equipment life). Our HVAC partners perform room-by-room load calculations using ACCA-approved software to specify equipment with appropriate capacity and properly sized ductwork for balanced airflow throughout your renovated space."
  },
  {
    patterns: ['r value calculation', 'insulation requirements', 'thermal boundary', 'continuous insulation', 'thermal bridging'],
    response: "Effective insulation strategies address not just nominal R-value but also installation quality, thermal bridging, and appropriate placement of the thermal boundary. Our approach includes evaluating wall assemblies with attention to insulation compression, voids, and thermal bridging through framing members (which typically conduct heat at R-1 per inch versus R-3.5-4 for insulation). We implement advanced framing techniques where appropriate, specify continuous insulation layers in key areas, and ensure proper air sealing as a critical companion to insulation. For existing homes, we consider both classical insulation placement and alternative strategies for challenging areas like floors over unconditioned spaces and cathedral ceilings with limited depth."
  },
  {
    patterns: ['moisture barrier installation', 'vapor barrier location', 'vapor retarder', 'vapor diffusion', 'moisture management'],
    response: "Proper moisture management requires careful consideration of vapor drive direction, which changes seasonally in Atlanta's mixed-humid climate zone. Our approach addresses both bulk water management through appropriate flashing details and vapor diffusion through strategic placement of vapor retarders. In our climate, vapor retarders should generally be placed on the exterior in cooling-dominated seasons and interior during heating seasons, creating a design challenge. We typically implement vapor-permeable weather-resistant barriers on the exterior, appropriate sheathing materials, and sometimes smart vapor retarders on interior surfaces that adjust permeance based on ambient humidity to accommodate seasonal changes in vapor drive direction."

Pre-formed pans are manufactured from acrylic, fiberglass, or composite materials in standard sizes and shapes, offering simple installation and reliable waterproofing. Custom pans are built on-site using traditional mortar bed methods or modern waterproofing systems like Schluter Kerdi, Wedi, or Laticrete Hydroban, allowing any size, shape, or tile design. The installation process includes proper slope creation for drainage (approximately 1/4 inch per foot), waterproofing that extends up walls 6-8 inches, and appropriate drain selection. Custom pans cost more but provide unlimited design flexibility for unique spaces."
  },
  {
    patterns: ['bathroom ventilation', 'bathroom fan', 'exhaust fan', 'steam removal', 'bathroom humidity'],
    response: "Proper bathroom ventilation prevents moisture damage, mold growth, and extended humidity levels. Bathroom exhaust fans should provide adequate air movement (minimum 50 CFM for standard bathrooms, 1 CFM per square foot for larger spaces) and vent directly outdoors, not into attics or crawlspaces. Modern options include humidity-sensing operation, built-in lighting, integrated speakers, and quiet motors (look for sones ratings under 1.5 for quietest operation). Proper installation includes sealing duct connections, insulating ductwork in unconditioned spaces to prevent condensation, and ensuring appropriate termination fixtures that prevent backdrafts. For optimal function, run fans during showers and for 20-30 minutes afterward to fully remove humidity."

  // Additional advanced bathroom questions
  {
    patterns: ['zero entry shower', 'curbless shower construction', 'barrier free shower', 'flush shower threshold', 'accessibility shower'],
    response: "Curbless shower construction requires precise floor height management to create proper drainage while maintaining a seamless transition. Implementation methods vary based on floor structure and finish floor height targets. For wood-framed floors, options include recessing the shower area by modifying floor joists, using specialized products like Wedi Fundo that minimize required depth, or creating a slightly elevated surrounding floor. For concrete slabs, we typically remove material to create proper recessing. All methods require careful waterproofing extending at least 24 inches beyond the shower entry and specialized drain systems (linear or multiple-point drains) to manage water effectively. Linear drains typically allow simpler single-slope shower floors versus traditional center drains requiring slopes from multiple directions."
  },
  {
    patterns: ['shower waterproofing methods', 'waterproofing shower walls', 'shower membrane systems', 'liquid waterproofing', 'shower wall prep'],
    response: "Modern shower waterproofing has evolved beyond traditional mortar bed and pan liner methods to include integrated systems with superior performance characteristics. We implement systems like Schluter Kerdi (sheet membrane adhered directly to drywall or cement board), Wedi (pre-waterproofed foam boards with integrated seam treatment), or Laticrete Hydroban (liquid-applied membrane creating a continuous waterproof surface). Each system includes coordinated components for transitions, corners, pipe penetrations, and niches. These modern systems eliminate the potentially problematic moisture sandwich created in traditional construction where moisture can become trapped between multiple waterproofing layers, offering simpler installation with superior moisture management compared to older cement board with vapor barrier approaches."

  // Additional advanced kitchen questions
  {
    patterns: ['kitchen ventilation requirements', 'range hood cfm', 'makeup air systems', 'kitchen exhaust', 'hood ventilation'],
    response: "Proper kitchen ventilation balances effective contaminant removal with building pressure considerations. For gas ranges, CFM requirements typically follow the formula: BTU output ÷ 100 = minimum CFM (e.g., 60,000 BTU range requires minimum 600 CFM). For electric ranges, 150-300 CFM suffices for standard residential use. Hood capture area should ideally extend 3 inches beyond cooking surface on all exposed sides, with mounting height per manufacturer specifications (typically 24-30 inches above cooking surface). For hoods exceeding 400 CFM, most jurisdictions now require makeup air systems that introduce replacement air to prevent negative pressure issues affecting HVAC equipment, gas appliance operation, and potentially drawing contaminants from wall cavities. Implementation includes motorized dampers linked to hood operation and appropriately sized ducts for balanced airflow."
