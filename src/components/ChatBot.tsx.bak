    patterns: ['what is a load bearing wall', 'which walls are structural', 'can i remove a wall', 'load bearing vs non load bearing', 'structural wall'],
    response: "Load-bearing walls support the weight of elements above them, while non-load-bearing walls (also called partition walls) simply divide spaces. Typically, walls running perpendicular to floor and ceiling joists are load-bearing, as are exterior walls and walls stacked vertically through multiple floors. Signs a wall might be load-bearing include being thicker, having beams or posts, or sitting above foundation walls. Never remove any wall without professional assessment, as even non-load-bearing walls might contain plumbing, electrical, or HVAC components. Our team can evaluate which walls can be safely modified during your renovation."

  // Additional advanced bathroom questions
  {
    patterns: ['zero entry shower', 'curbless shower construction', 'barrier free shower', 'flush shower threshold', 'accessibility shower'],
    response: "Curbless shower construction requires precise floor height management to create proper drainage while maintaining a seamless transition. Implementation methods vary based on floor structure and finish floor height targets. For wood-framed floors, options include recessing the shower area by modifying floor joists, using specialized products like Wedi Fundo that minimize required depth, or creating a slightly elevated surrounding floor. For concrete slabs, we typically remove material to create proper recessing. All methods require careful waterproofing extending at least 24 inches beyond the shower entry and specialized drain systems (linear or multiple-point drains) to manage water effectively. Linear drains typically allow simpler single-slope shower floors versus traditional center drains requiring slopes from multiple directions."
  },
  {
    patterns: ['shower waterproofing methods', 'waterproofing shower walls', 'shower membrane systems', 'liquid waterproofing', 'shower wall prep'],
    response: "Modern shower waterproofing has evolved beyond traditional mortar bed and pan liner methods to include integrated systems with superior performance characteristics. We implement systems like Schluter Kerdi (sheet membrane adhered directly to drywall or cement board), Wedi (pre-waterproofed foam boards with integrated seam treatment), or Laticrete Hydroban (liquid-applied membrane creating a continuous waterproof surface). Each system includes coordinated components for transitions, corners, pipe penetrations, and niches. These modern systems eliminate the potentially problematic moisture sandwich created in traditional construction where moisture can become trapped between multiple waterproofing layers, offering simpler installation with superior moisture management compared to older cement board with vapor barrier approaches."

  // Additional advanced kitchen questions
  {
    patterns: ['kitchen ventilation requirements', 'range hood cfm', 'makeup air systems', 'kitchen exhaust', 'hood ventilation'],
    response: "Proper kitchen ventilation balances effective contaminant removal with building pressure considerations. For gas ranges, CFM requirements typically follow the formula: BTU output ÷ 100 = minimum CFM (e.g., 60,000 BTU range requires minimum 600 CFM). For electric ranges, 150-300 CFM suffices for standard residential use. Hood capture area should ideally extend 3 inches beyond cooking surface on all exposed sides, with mounting height per manufacturer specifications (typically 24-30 inches above cooking surface). For hoods exceeding 400 CFM, most jurisdictions now require makeup air systems that introduce replacement air to prevent negative pressure issues affecting HVAC equipment, gas appliance operation, and potentially drawing contaminants from wall cavities. Implementation includes motorized dampers linked to hood operation and appropriately sized ducts for balanced airflow."
