INSTRUCTIONS FOR MANUALLY FIXING THE CHATBOT.TSX FILE:

1. Open the src/components/ChatBot.tsx file
2. Look for the section labeled "// Custom Cabinetry" around line 1700
3. The entries under this section incorrectly contain patterns for "whole home renovation", "home addition", and "basement finishing" which are duplicates of earlier entries
4. Replace these entries with the following cabinetry-related entries:

Replace:
```
  // Custom Cabinetry
  {
    patterns: ["whole home renovation", "complete house remodel", "full house renovation"],
    response: "Our whole home renovation services transform your entire living space with a cohesive design approach."
  },
  {
    patterns: ["home addition", "room addition", "house extension"],
    response: "Our home addition services increase your living space while maintaining architectural harmony."
  },
  {
    patterns: ["basement finishing", "basement remodel", "basement renovation"],
    response: "Our basement finishing transforms underutilized space into valuable living areas."
  }
```

With:
```
  // Custom Cabinetry
  {
    patterns: ["custom cabinets", "built-in cabinetry", "cabinet design"],
    response: "Our custom cabinetry services provide tailored storage solutions for kitchens, bathrooms, offices, entertainment areas, and more. We design and build to your exact specifications with premium materials."
  },
  {
    patterns: ["cabinet maker", "built-ins", "storage solutions"],
    response: "Custom cabinetry transforms spaces with personalized organization systems. Our cabinet designs incorporate specialized storage features like pull-out organizers and divided drawers."
  }
```

This will fix the duplicate entries and properly add conversation patterns for cabinetry services.
